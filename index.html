                <h3>About Schorndorf</h3>
                <p>Located in the romantic Remstal, nature lovers and history enthusiasts will find beautiful Schorndorf surrounded by majestic vineyards that are bursting with colour, especially in autumn. You can explore them on one of the many hiking trails. From the new viewing platform on the Grafenberg, you have a magnificent view over Schorndorf and the surrounding area, which you can also discover on the Remstal cycle path. The newly renaturalised River Rems makes its way through the town and invites adults to relax and children to go sandblasting. </p>

                    If you penetrate further into the centre of Schorndorf, a backdrop of half-timbered houses awaits you, the likes of which are seldom seen. At the heart of the historic market square is the Old Town Hall dating from 1730. Even older is the late Gothic town church with its 66-metre-high tower, which can also be climbed. The church tower is rivalled only by the post office tower, which is 45 metres high.
                    If you want to explore the city, simply join one of the many guided tours. Gottlieb Daimler himself will show you his birthplace and tell you about his vision and his life. City heroine Barbara KÃ¼nkelin takes you back to 1688, when she drove the French army away with the Schorndorf Women. During the culinary tours, you can taste from Schorndorf pots and pans or experience wine in Swabian.
                    In the town museum, you can learn all about Schorndorf's eventful history and in the research factory, clever children's minds can experiment. In the castle park, children can explore the new playground in the shadow of the castle. The town park also has a new playground, and a pirate ship stranded on the town lake and a sound garden can be explored.
                    The Old Cemetery - an oasis of peace in lively Schorndorf - invites you to take a stroll. The nearby Feuersee lake has been freshly spruced up for the Remstal Garden Show 2019 and boasts a unique flair and water fountains.
                    It is rare to find such a variety of leisure activities and different sights. But why not see for yourself - in the Daimler town of Schorndorf.
